## Pricing Component Demo
Simple pricing tier chart made with React and Bootstrap.  The chart is a single web page with three different pricing boxes. The page is responsive and shifts from a horizontal layout to vertical on smaller screens.

Using CSS, the active pricing plan will enlarge slightly (when hovering).
